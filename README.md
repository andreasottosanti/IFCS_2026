### Analyses performed for the IFCS2026 proceeding 

To download the data, go to https://github.com/Teichlab/SpatialDE.git and navigate to Analysis/MouseOB/data

To reproduce the analyses, use the **main.R** file. The repository contains also the code to perform the analysis on the GLMPCA rather than on the genes expressions directly, not reported in the proceeding.
